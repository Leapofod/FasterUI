This mod aims to remove some slowdowns in the game UI that occur when the game lags due to their animation or interaction speed being tied to framerate

Currently these include:
- The scroll speed of the crafting menu
- The acceleration and speed of crafting items in bulk
- The acceleration and speed of buying items in bulk or picking up items in bulk with Right click
