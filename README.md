# Faster UI

<!-- Github Readme badges here -->

This is a mod for Terraria which slightly modifies the UI code to allow for
some animations and interactions to not be bound in speed by the in-game FPS.

## Features
- Unbound crafting list scroll speed
- Compensation for FPS during mass item crafting or mass item grabbing in inventory

## Limitations
This mod doesn't poll inputs any faster so inputs will still only be picked up every frame.
